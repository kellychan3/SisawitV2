## Project Overview

**SisawitV2** is a web-based system that implements **Business Intelligence (BI)** to monitor the productivity of palm oil plantations.
It integrates harvest data collected through the SawitKu mobile app, processes it via an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline using **Pentaho Data Integration (PDI)**, and visualizes the results through an interactive web dashboard.

The system is developed using the **CodeIgniter 3** framework, with **MySQL** as the database and **Docker** for simplified deployment and environment management.

## Problem Statement
Based on interviews with palm oil farmers and plantation owners located in Riau, Indonesia, the previous monitoring system did not fully support data-driven decision-making in the field.

**Key issues identified**:
- The previous dashboard did not display recent harvest trends, which are essential for monitoring at least three consecutive harvests (within 1â€“2 weeks) to detect productivity changes.
- Several existing charts were irrelevant to productivity analysis and required redesign.
- Fertilizer stock information was not visualized, even though it is crucial for anticipating shortages caused by delayed deliveries.

These findings led to the development of a new Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard in SisawitV2, designed to visualize comprehensive harvest performance by week, month, and plantation block to help users understand productivity patterns and make better operational decisions.


## Objectives
To develop a Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard that comprehensively displays and analyzes palm plantation data to support better operational and strategic decisions.

**Key Features**:
- Visualize harvest results by week, month, and plantation block.
- Display fertilizer stock and plantation data.
- Visualize harvest yield predictions generated from an external deep learning model (developed in a separate research project).

**Main Benefits**:
- Enable users to analyze productivity trends.
- Provide insight into each plantationâ€™s contribution to total yield.
- Help monitor fertilizer stock levels and plantation data efficiently.
- Present yield predictions as a reference to support planning and decision-making related to future harvesting and resource allocation.

## System Architecture
SisawitV2 consists of four integrated components:

- SawitKu (Mobile App): Serves as the input platform for field operational data, including planting, fertilizing, and harvesting activities.
- Pentaho Data Integration (ETL): Performs the Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) process to move and structure data according to the defined data warehouse schema.

- MySQL Data Warehouse: Acts as the repository that stores integrated and structured plantation data for analysis.

- SisawitV2 Dashboard (Web App): Visualizes harvest results and yield predictions through an interactive BI dashboard. Additional plantation data such as planting and fertilizing records are accessible through dedicated table views in the side menu.

## Testing Summary
Testing was conducted through two main phases to evaluate functionalitya and usability.
- **User Acceptance Test (UAT)**: All functional requirements were met successfully, with a 100% success rate across all user roles and testing scenarios. The system operated smoothly without major issues, including core features such as harvest visualization, fertilizer stock monitoring, and predictive yield dashboards.

- **Usability Test**: The dashboard achieved an average System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 90%. Users rated the system as easy to use, intuitive, and helpful for monitoring and analysis, confirming that the dashboard effectively supports real-world decision-making needs.

## Conclusion
SisawitV2 successfully integrates palm plantation operational data into a comprehensive Business Intelligence dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.
The system enables users to:
- Monitor and analyze harvest productivity trends in real time.
- Track fertilizer stock and field activities effectively.
- Visualize predictive yield data to plan future harvesting and resource allocation.
